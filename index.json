Particularly, students will learn how to explore, analyze, and visualize natural language (text) as well as relational (network) data.\nM3: Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence for Analytics Introduces to the most recent developments in machine learning, which are deep learning and artificial intelligence applications. The module will provide a solid foundation for this exciting and rapidly developing field. Students will learn whether and how to apply deep learning techniques for business analytics, and acquire proficiency in new methods autonomously.\nM4: Capstone Project  Submission ~8/1 2021 Requirements  "},{"uri":"https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS2021-test/info/04_litetrature/","title":"Literature &amp; Resources","tags":[],"description":"","content":"While this course does not come with a list of mandatory readings, we will often refer to some central resources in R and python, which for the most part can always be accessed in a free and updated online version.
