Particularly, students will learn how to explore, analyze, and visualize natural language (text) as well as relational (network) data.\nM3: Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence for Analytics Introduces to the most recent developments in machine learning, which are deep learning and artificial intelligence applications. The module will provide a solid foundation for this exciting and rapidly developing field. Students will learn whether and how to apply deep learning techniques for business analytics, and acquire proficiency in new methods autonomously.\nM4: Semester Project  Submission ~8/1 2021 Requirements  "},{"uri":"https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS2021-test/categories/","title":"Categories","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS2021-test/","title":"Social Data Science 2021","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Social Data Science 2021 Aalborg University Business School The corresponding Aalborg University Moodle course page can be found here.
