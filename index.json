Immerse yourself into the increasingly relevant and fast-emerging sector of data analytics, starting September 2018. Through this programme, you will learn cutting-edge, requisite skills in, practical terms, and be able to apply them to real-world issues in various fields. Data continues to grow exponentially. From Social media posts, sensor signals on smartphones, smart home devices to the increasing digitisation of companies and public organisations, data has seen unprecedented granularity.\nModules M1: Applied Data Science and Machine Learning\nThis module will prove a condensed introduction to the “Data Science Pipeline”, introducing students to methods, techniques, and workflows in applied data analytics and machine learning, including data acquisition, preparation, analysis, visualization, and communication.\nM2: Network Analysis and Natural Language Processing\nFocuses on analyzing a variety of unstructured data sources. Particularly, students will learn how to explore, analyze, and visualize natural language (text) as well as relational (network) data.\nM3: Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence for Analytics\nIntroduces to the most recent developments in machine learning, which are deep learning and artificial intelligence applications. The module will provide a solid foundation for this exciting and rapidly developing field. Students will learn whether and how to apply deep learning techniques for business analytics, and acquire proficiency in new methods autonomously.\nM4: Semester Project\nThis modlue is a 15 ECTS project to be completed in collaboration with an external partner (optimally). External organisations can not only provide real-life datasets but also motivate students through real problems, and help to adjust the curriculum to make contents most relevant in terms of employability. The teaching staff will assist students with significant guidance and coordination to identify potential, mutually benefiting areas of project-collaboration with external partners.\nSchedule and Calendar +\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026ndash;+\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026ndash;+\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026ndash;+ | Semester | Key Dates | Topics | +==========================+==========================+==========================+ | M1: Week 36-41 | - In-person workshop | - W 36: Introduction \u0026amp; | | | days: W37 - | landing | | | 08.09.2020, W38 - | - W 37: Data | | | 18.09.2020 | Manipulation, | | | - M1 individual | Exploratory Data | | | assignment 1: | Analysis (EDA), Data | | | hand-in deadline | Visualization | | | 10.09.2020 23:59:00 | - W 38: Unsupervised | | | at the latest | Machine Learning | | | (Peergrade) | (UML) | | | - M1 individual | - W 39: Supervised | | | assignment 2: | Machine Learning | | | hand-in deadline | (SML) | | | 22.09.2020 23:59:00 | - W 40: Project work | | | at the latest | | | | (Peergrade) | | | | - Group assignment: | | | | 25.09.2020 - | | | | 01.10.2020 (Digital | | | | Eksamen) | | +\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026ndash;+\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026ndash;+\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026ndash;+ | M2: Week 41-46 | - in-person workshop | - W 41: Introduction | | | days: W42 - | to Network Analysis | | | 12.10.2020, W43 - | - W 42: Introduction | | | 22.10.2020 | to | | | - M2 individual | Natural-Language-Pro | | | assignment 1: | cessing | | | hand-in deadline | (NLP) | | | 15.10.2020 23:59:00 | - W 44: Advanced | | | at the latest | applications in | | | (Peergrade) | Network and Text | | | - M2 individual | Analysis | | | assignment 2: | - W 45: Project work | | | hand-in deadline | | | | 28.10.2020 23:59:00 | | | | at the latest | | | | (Peergrade) | | | | - Group assignment: | | | | 30.10.2020-05.11.202 | | | | 0 | | | | (Digital Eksamen) | | +\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026ndash;+\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026ndash;+\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026ndash;+ | M3: Week 46-51 | - In-person workshop | - W 46: Introduction | | | days: W47 - | to Artificial Neural | | | 16.11.2020 + | Networks (ANN) \u0026amp; | | | 19.12.2020, W48 - | Deep Learning (DL) | | | 26.11.2020 | - W 47: Neural | | | - M3 individual | networks for spatial | | | assignment 1: | data: Recurrent | | | hand-in deadline | Neural Networks | | | 01.12.2020 23:59:00 | (RNN) | | | at the latest | - W 48: Neural | | | (Peergrade) | Networks for | | | - Group assignment: | sequential data: | | | 03.12.2020-09.12.202 | Recurrent Neural | | | 0 | networks (RNN \u0026amp; | | | (Digital Eksamen) | LSTM) | | | | - W 49\u0026amp;50: AdvancedDL | | | | applications \u0026amp; | | | | project work | +\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026ndash;+\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026ndash;+\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026ndash;+\nMain Teaching Reference While this course does not come with a list of mandatory readings, we will often refer to some central resources in R and python, which for the most part can always be accessed in a free and updated online version.
