In this workshop we are going to explore the [nomad data (cities)](https://nomadlist.com/) using unsupervised ML techniques.
We used the data in a research project some years ago and you can check out a conference presentation below:

### Things to do!

You will find the data for today's session here: `https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-master/M1/data/cities.csv`
Use the template from the Penguin analysis with UML and build a notebook that covers following steps:

- Stratup
  - Load up and explore the data (a bit)
  - Clean up if you thing you neeed to
  - Select the nummerical variables to be used for UML
  - Preprocess the data for UML
- Dimensionality reduction
  - Use PCA for dimensionality reduction
  - Explore variable loading
  - Plot 1. vs 2. component
  - If you want, use another algorithm for the same steps and compare results
- Clustering
  - Perform a clustering on the reduced data
  - Plot the clusters into the above visualization
  - Explore the results (clusters vs components / clusters vs aggregated variables of interest)
