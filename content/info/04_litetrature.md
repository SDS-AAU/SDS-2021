While this course does not come with a list of mandatory readings, we will often refer to some central resources in R and python, which for the most part can always be accessed in a free and updated online version.  We generally recommend you to use these amazing resources for problem-solving and further self-study on the topic.

# Main Literature

These pieces of work can be seen as main references for data science using R and Python. We will frequently refer to selected chapters for further study.
