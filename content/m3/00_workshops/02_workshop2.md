## Introduction 

### Context: LSTMS and timeseries


You have so far seen how RNNs are used for simle time series. In this workshop we will extend this to multi-step and simultaneusely multi-feature and multi-step situations.
Today we are going to make some money 💸 [^1]
We will be using financial data for that. There will be no time for backtesting however.




### 1. Build a baseline LSTM 
Build an LSTM net that predicts closing price changes 1 day ahead


### 2. Extend to multi-step 
Build an LSTM net that looks n timesteps back to predict the next period


### 3. Extend to multi-step and multi-feature
Build an LSTM that uses several inputs (e.g. other stocks or TA features)
