This should apply the following tasks.
Identify an interesting problem that can be tackled using netork analysis and NLP techniques. Optimally, this is done within one dataset. However, the assignment can also be done using 2 different datasets, if nothing suitable combinging both elements of netork analysis and NLP is found.</description></item><item><title>M3 (Mandatory) Assignment</title><link>https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-2021/m3/00_assignments/group_assignment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-2021/m3/00_assignments/group_assignment/</guid><description>SDS 2021 - M3: (Mandatory) Assignment M3 - Group Assignment Deep learning is particularly well suited when working with unstructured and complex data types. Neural network architectures are extremely flexible and can be adapted to different types of problems, which in part explains their popularity today.
Your task is to build and use a deep learning architecture to explore a problem setting (optimnally) within your main area of study. But you are welcome to work on other issues, too.</description></item><item><title>Semester Schedule</title><link>https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-2021/info/03_schedule/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-2021/info/03_schedule/</guid><description>M1: Week 35-39 Topics W 35: Introduction &amp;amp; landing W 36: Data Manipulation, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualization W 37: Unsupervised Machine Learning (UML) W 38: Supervised Machine Learning (SML) W 39: Project work + exam Key Dates Individual assignment 1: 08.-13.09.2021, 23:59:00 at the latest (Peergrade) 2: 15.-20.09.2021, 23:59:00 at the latest (Peergrade) Group assignment: 21.-27.09.2021 (Digital Eksamen) Final exam: 29.09.2021 M2: Week 40-44 Topics W 40: Introduction to Network Analysis W 41: Introduction to Natural-Language-Processing (NLP) W 43: Advanced applications in Network and Text Analysis W 44: Project work + exam Key Dates M2 individual assignment 1: 04.</description></item><item><title>Workshop 3 - Advanced applicaions and wrap-up</title><link>https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-2021/m3/00_workshops/03_workshop3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-2021/m3/00_workshops/03_workshop3/</guid><description>That&amp;rsquo;s it In our last workshop we will be wrapping up the semester with some advanced applications, tooling and dicussion about the semester project.
