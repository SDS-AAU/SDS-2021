Further, you are provided with a countries list, a dataset containing information on countries, regions and countrycodes.
Trips data: holds ~46k individual trips of travelers on the platform. URL:https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-master/M1/data/trips.csv
People data: contains some personal information on 4k travelers URL:https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-master/M1/data/people.csv
Country data: Holds countrycodes, contrynames and region-associations URL:https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-master/M1/data/countrylist.csv
Use the pandas read csv function to read the URLs into your working notebook, as shown in SDS examples.</description></item><item><title>Assignment 2 - UML with Pokemon</title><link>https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-2021/m1/00_assignments/assignment2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-2021/m1/00_assignments/assignment2/</guid><description>Description This time you will work with Pokemon data.

Data The data is available through the URL: https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-master/00_data/pokemon.csv. It contains data on 800 Pokemon from the 1st to the 6th generation.
Tasks Give a brief overview of data, what variables are there, how are the variables scaled and variation of the data columns.</description></item><item><title>Group Assignment</title><link>https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-2021/m1/00_assignments/group_assignment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-2021/m1/00_assignments/group_assignment/</guid><description>SDS 2021 - M1: Group Assignment Introduction With the individual assignments, you already performed most of the steps in a typical machine learning pipeline. You imported some data, cleaned it, explored the variables and their relationships using summary statistics and visualisations. You also exercised some standard machine learning preprocessing procedures such as feature scaling and dealing with missing values.
You practised unsupervised machine learning techniques for dimensionality reduction (e.g. PCA) and clustering (e.</description></item></channel></rss>
