They wrote in 2019:
We built an artificial intelligence model by fine-tuning GPT-2 to generate tweets in the style of Donald Trump’s Twitter account. After seeing the results, we also built a discriminator that can accurately detect fake tweets 77% of the time — think you can beat our classifier? Try it yourself!
Unfortunately, they decided to take down the site and the dataset.</description></item><item><title>M3 (Mandatory) Assignment</title><link>https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-2021/m3/00_assignments/group_assignment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-2021/m3/00_assignments/group_assignment/</guid><description>SDS 2021 - M3: (Mandatory) Assignment M3 - Group Assignment Deep learning is particularly well suited when working with unstructured and complex data types. Neural network architectures are extremely flexible and can be adapted to different types of problems, which in part explains their popularity today.
Your task is to build and use a deep learning architecture to explore a problem setting (optimnally) within your main area of study. But you are welcome to work on other issues, too.</description></item></channel></rss>
