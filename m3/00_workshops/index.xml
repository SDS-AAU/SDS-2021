We used the data in a research project some years ago and you can check out a conference presentation below:
1. Build a neural net for price prediction. Your job is to build a feed-forward network using Keras to predict the price. Can you beat the performance of other models that we explored in M1 (using the same set of independent variables)?</description></item><item><title>Workshop 2 - Fun with Timeseries</title><link>https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-2021/m3/00_workshops/02_workshop2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-2021/m3/00_workshops/02_workshop2/</guid><description>Introduction Context: LSTMS and timeseries You have so far seen how RNNs are used for simle time series. In this workshop we will extend this to multi-step and simultaneusely multi-feature and multi-step situations. Today we are going to make some money ðŸ’¸ 1 We will be using financial data for that. There will be no time for backtesting however.
1. Build a baseline LSTM Build an LSTM net that predicts closing price changes 1 day ahead</description></item><item><title>Workshop 3 - Advanced applicaions and wrap-up</title><link>https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-2021/m3/00_workshops/03_workshop3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-2021/m3/00_workshops/03_workshop3/</guid><description>That&amp;rsquo;s it In our last workshop we will be wrapping up the semester with some advanced applications, tooling and dicussion about the semester project. We will cover following approaches (tutrial / demos - some variation between R &amp;amp; Python):
SBERT - sentence embedding Autoencoders (for anomaly detection) Text classification with Fast.ai and Transformers We will also demonstrate how to create and host portfolios as static sites on Github Pages.</description></item></channel></rss>
