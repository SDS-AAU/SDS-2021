They wrote in 2019:
We built an artificial intelligence model by fine-tuning GPT-2 to generate tweets in the style of Donald Trump’s Twitter account. After seeing the results, we also built a discriminator that can accurately detect fake tweets 77% of the time — think you can beat our classifier? Try it yourself!
Unfortunately, they decided to take down the site and the dataset.</description></item><item><title>Assignment 2 - NLP</title><link>https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-2021/m2/00_assignments/assignment2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-2021/m2/00_assignments/assignment2/</guid><description>Introduction: Building a Hate Speech Classifier This assignment is less structured than previous individual assignments.
You are given a collection of approximately 25k tweets that have been manually (human) annotated. class denotes: 0 - hate speech, 1 - offensive language, 2 - neither

1. Preprocessing and vectorizaion. Justify your choices and explain possible alternatives (e.g. removing stopwords, identifying bi/tri-grams, removing verbs or use of stemming, lemmatization etc.)
Create a bag-of-words representation, apply TF-IDF and dimensionality reduction (LSA-topic modelling alternatively simply PCA or SVD) to transform your corpus into a feature matrix.</description></item><item><title>M2 (Mandatory) Assignment</title><link>https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-2021/m2/00_assignments/group_assignment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-2021/m2/00_assignments/group_assignment/</guid><description>SDS 2021 - M2: (Mandatory) Assignment Introduction Now it is time to bring most these steps together and apply them to a setting that you find interesting. This should apply the following tasks.
Identify an interesting problem that can be tackled using netork analysis and NLP techniques. Optimally, this is done within one dataset. However, the assignment can also be done using 2 different datasets, if nothing suitable combinging both elements of netork analysis and NLP is found.</description></item></channel></rss>
